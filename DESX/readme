This package, DESX, consists of C functions to implement the
DESX cipher, plus a main driver program.

DESX is a simple extension of DES invented by RSA Data Security.
RSA has been using DESX in their commercial products since 1986.

The DES and DESX implementations here were done by Richard Outerbridge,
based on my description of the algorithm to him.  RSADSI claims
no ownership of the DESX algorithm, but they did copyright their
implementation of DESX.  They showed me their implementation
of DESX.  I wrote an English description of the algorithm and
showed it to Richard.  This thus is a "clean-room" implementation,
because the code was written by someone who never saw RSA's
source code.

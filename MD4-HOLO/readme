This package is MD4 message digest algorithm modified for DOS (8086).
Read accompanied RFC1186 what the MD4 is and what it is not.

I mostly (>90%) stole the MD4 code from the RFC and as such it must be
distributed under the terms specified in md4.c.
Thanks to Mr. Rivest for the code and to RSA Data Security, Inc. for
giving the permission to use it.

Note that md4 -t gives a different digest compared to the C program in
the RFC. This is because only 640K bytes is processed. The output should
be: (8 MHz 80286)

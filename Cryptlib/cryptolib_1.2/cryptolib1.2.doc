Announcing CryptoLib - Release 1.2		1/12/96
   Jack Lacy, AT&T Bell Labs

CryptoLib is a portable and efficient library of primitives
for building cryptographic applications.  It runs under most versions
of Unix as well as DOS, Windows and Windows-NT (and 95).

We are pleased to make CryptoLib source code available without charge
to researchers and developers in the US and Canada.  (Because of export
restrictions on cryptographic software, we are only able to make the
software available within the US and Canada to US and Canadian citizens
and US permanent residents.)

CryptoLib is intended for research and experimental use, and is
distributed without warranty or support.  In particular, please
note the following license conditions:

 *              Copyright (c) 1995 by AT&T.

 * all copies of any software which is or includes a copy or
 * modification of this software and in all copies of the supporting
 * documentation for such software.

 * This software may be subject to export controls.
 *
 * SOME PARTS OF CRYPTOLIB MAY BE RESTRICTED UNDER UNITED STATES EXPORT
 * REGULATIONS.

Some timing information:

All times assume 32X32 bit assembly of multiplication primitives.

bigPow times (a^b mod c with a,b,c the same length)

		512 bits	1024 bits
		--------	---------
bigPow		0.12s		0.72s		Sparc II Brickell bigpow
		0.43s		3.0s		Sparc II with asm (gcc)
		0.12s		0.78s		Sparc 10 with asm
		0.03s		0.17s		Sparc 10 with asm (Brickell)
		0.084s		0.45s		SGI Indigo (150MHz)
		0.109s		0.75s		100 MHz Pentium (gcc under DOS)

Strong Prime Generation -- ProbTestAttempts = 5
100 primes generated in each test.  Times below are:
(total test time)/100 = avg. time per prime generated.
Using Gordon's strong prime algorithm.

    256		512	1024	Machine
    ---		---	----	-------
    2.8s	24.0s	5.11m	Sparc II 
    .45s	2.7s	77s	100 MHz pentium
	


	RSA Times (64 bit public exponent, message encrypted is full length)

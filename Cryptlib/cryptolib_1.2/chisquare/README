This code is an implementation of CHI-square tests from Knuth Vol. 2.
Run make.  An executable called chisquare will be created.

chisquare inputfile

will return CHI-square results.  Read Knuth for interpretation.
inputfile should be at least 1Mbyte of random binary data.
This has been tested only under Unix.

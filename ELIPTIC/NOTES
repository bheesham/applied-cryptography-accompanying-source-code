Notes made during the creation of v2.1

1) elliptic.doc talkes about the flaten() routine although it has been
   eliminated from ecliptic.c as of v2.

2) v2 complains about too-short pass phrases, but tries to use them
   anyway.  Since this is a functional issue, I left is for the next
   major version.

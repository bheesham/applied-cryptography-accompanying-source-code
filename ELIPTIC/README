This is version 2.1 of the elliptic curve public key encryption package
by Mike Rosing(Dr. mike) <cryptech.mcs.net>.  It is functionally
identical to the 2.0 release except for a few minor bug fixes and a
lot of portability-enhancing clean-up.  A detailed list of the changes
made since v2.0 can be found in the "CHANGES" file.  Other innocuous
porting notes are contained in the "NOTES" file.

The 2.0 release was developed on a Mac running the MachTen kernel.
Every attempt was made in the v2.1 port to not introduce changes
that would be troublesome on the platform, since I could not test
on it.

The 2.1 release was testing on the following platforms:

386-based PC

> MS-DOS v5 and v6 using Borland C++ v6.0

> Linux v 1.0.9 and gcc v 2.5.8

Sun SPARCstation 10

> SunOS v 4.1.3 and gcc v 2.7.0(and also briefly of 2.6.3)

> SunOS v 4.1.3 and SunPro acc v 2.0

> SunOS v 4.1.3 and the default SunOS cc compiler

Dr. mike tells me that v 1.0 has more than historic interest for
anyone who want to use a different key length.  It was not
difficult to get v1.0 to compile on any of the platforms listed
above.  Refer to the included eliptic.doc file for details on
this and other aspects of Dr. mike's implementation and for
references to the mathematical texts and papers on which it is
based.

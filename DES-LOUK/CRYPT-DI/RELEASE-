A new release of my encryption program package is available at
kampi.hut.fi (128.214.3.9). The package has now arbitrary precision
integer arithmetic library with all the necessary functions for RSA
and other exponentiation ciphers. I didn't include the RSA program in
this release because I don't want anyone having a patented software
if one don't want to. I will release a RSA program later.

Instead, there is program share-secret which allows two parties to
communicate securely over insecure communication channel. Only a
low-bandwidth channel which is free from active taps, is required.

There are some enhancements in des program, too. It has now flag which
makes it compatible with standard SUN des(1) program.

Package has been tested on VAX (BSD 4.3) and SUN-3 (SUNOS 4.0). For
best results, you should use GNU C-compiler, but other compilers
should also work.

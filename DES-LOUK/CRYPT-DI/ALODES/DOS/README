The purpose of scripts in this directory is to copy DES sources for
DOS environment. script get-file-names prints all relevant source file
names and copy-files.perl copies files into corresponding directories
here. File names are converted into a suitable form for DOS.

Put files in this collection under directory alodes/dos cd there and
give command:

./get-file-names | ./copy-files.perl

To run this, you need perl, of course. After this, copy directories
lib libdir and prog to a DOS machine and compile.

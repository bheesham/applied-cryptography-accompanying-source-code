This program should compile just fine on VAX with BSD 4.3. On SUNS,
you should edit Makerules to include -msoft-float option if you don't
have FPU. For other machines you should typedef des_u_long to be an
unsigned 32-bit integer type. If processor needs aligned multi-byte
accesses, you may have to modify copy* -macros in des-private.h file.

This is an arbitrary precision arithmetic implementation written by
Antti Louko (alo@kampi.hut.fi). It is based partly on alogorithms in
Knuth's book "Seminumerical algorithms". At this time you may use this
program for non-commercial use. If you modify the program, you must
add a comment in the modified file indicating who modified it. For
commercial purposes please contact me.

If you find bugs or otherwise modify this program, please send
changes back to me.

This package will be (I hope) part of the next BSD release. This
means that the above copyright will be most probably changed to a less
restrictive one.

In any case, I would greatly appreciate if I would get credit for
development of this package and support to develop more cryptographic
software which can be used all over the world.

I am not quite satisfied with this package yet. In my opinion (and
Keith Bostics) it should contain also floating point capability. If
you have suggestions and/or enhancements, please send them to me.

Ndc program under prog directory is a dc type program which now
calculates only integer and rational numbers. It should be extended to
handle real numbers, too.

I decided to release this now because there seems to be a need for
exponentiation ciphers. For examnple, this package can be used to
implement RSA or Diffie-Hellman scheme. DH is used in SUNs secure
RPC package as a secret shaering mechanism.

share-secret gives an opportunity to send encrypted messages over
network if there is a mean to transfer shorter messages unaltered
between sites (by telephone, for example).

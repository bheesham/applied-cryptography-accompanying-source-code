 If you have bugs, fixes, etc.  Please send them to
 support@stephsf.com.  We don't guarantee to fix them 
 but, we'll certainly look at them.


KNOWN BUGS:

  It does not work using the Metaware C compiler on a 386
  CTOS (Unisys) system. I gave up and hacked it in assembler.


THEORY:

  The authors of the original ACM article are continuing research 
  and work on LCG's and are available via email.

(BLOWPAS.zip)
   - First assembly implementation by  John Lots and Walter van Holst.
   - Assembly rewrite by Jeroen Pluimers

(BLWCBC10.zip)
   - CBC Mode Implementations by Dutra Lacerda using the BlowPas Unit.

(BLWCBC11.zip)
   + Unit Rewrite improving 15X the Pascal Code (1500%)

(BLWCBC12.zip)
   + Unit  Assembly  Use improving 5X the previous Pascal Code  (500%)
     and therefore being twice as fast  than  the  BLOWPAS  386  code.

(BLCBC13.zip)
   ! Discovered the Initialization Bug in the  Lots-Holst BLOWPAS Unit
     used in previou versions while making a complete code rewrite.
     Meaning: PREVIOUS VERSIONS ARE NOT SECURE.
   + Correction made and Source code released,  before  its  time,  to
     protect users and developers.
   * Improvements in progress in the assembly and general code  to  be
     made  public  domain  when  I  get  TASM 4.0 to make the 386 code
     (twice faster) and the general routines are converted to Objects.

(BLWCBC14.zip)
   ! Discovered a small Bug still herited from the the BlowPas Unit in
     the init routine of the algorithm... (again!) This one is smaller
     than the one corrected in version 1.3  but still affects security
     though in a  much lesser degree   ( one of the 4 P-Boxes  was not
     initialized... meaning that the program was  still safe,  but not
     as  much  as desired and/or expected)
   + Added a random CBC Init Vector. Forgotten  in  demo  version 1.3.
     This small change makes the cipher text less vulnerable to known
     text attack. And also means that:
     THIS  VERSION  IS  NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS ONES.
   * This also means this version is no longer a  demo  but  a  strong
     cipher program.
   * Also changed my idea of making the ASM code public.
     Still waiting to get my hands on TASM 4.0 (This is a hard life!)
     Now only the TP7 will be public.

(BLWCBC15.zip)
   + Added  a  New  Field  in  the EOF Header to restore the  original
     encrypted file extension (used only if  NO  output  argument  has
     been declared).
   + Full COMPATIBILITY with 1.4 and FUTURE versions.
   + Added I/O check routines and a RunTime Error Trap routine.
     (This demo is becoming a little bit more than that... Humm!)

   = Full COMPATIBILITY with 1.4 and FUTURE versions.
   ! A 'Writeln' in a wrong place produced a incorrect layout.
   + Better I/O errors control
   + Disk Full check added
   + ErrorLevel file added to benefit Power-Users
   + Read-me file with important TIPS was also added

(BLWCB15B.zip)
   + Small code change to make it compatible with Delphi's Object Pascal.

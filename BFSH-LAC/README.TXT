
    Hello!

    Since there are no need for docs, this read-me file should do it.


    TIPS
    ~~~~
        1 - Compress you file BEFORE encrypting it, if you  will  want
            to have the benefit of compression.
            Encrypted  files  are NOT compressible... So do-it BEFORE!

        2 - Use LONG passphrases,  since the security of a  Good crypt
            algorithm depends on the passphrase and its  length.  This
            program   can   have   passphrases  up  to  576  bits  !!!

        3 - The original file is still on your disk...  If that is NOT
            in your idea, then use Norton Utilities to Erase the  file
            and  every  non  used  disk  space...  You  may  have data
            residues somewhere on the  disk, and certainly on RAM.
            It's upon you those other security circumstances.

        4 - To increase  even further  your passphrase safety  you may
            then COMPRESS your files.
            Compressed files are very much like encrypted files except
            for  the header, but even if BLW-CBC hadn't be implemented
            the in CBC mode the result would still be VERY  effective!


    WARNINGS
    ~~~~~~~~
        1 - By default, the output file AS the very same name  as  the
            original but a different extension....
               MEANING:
            IF Enciphering Many files  with  the  same  name  name  in
            common  will  overwrite  the  previously encrypted file...
               SOLUTION:
            If you want to  encrypt  many  unique-name  files  USE  an
            ARCHIVER or a COMPRESSOR that allows MULTI-FILE inside.

        2 - If you forget the name of the file you encrypted, then you
            have lost that info...
               MEANING:
            The only info allowed to the peeker are the Extension  and
            the Size of the original.
               SOLUTION:
            Use  a  COMPRESSOR  like RAR, ARJ, ZIP or LHA... your info
            will be inside, protected and you will also save  valuable
            disk space.


    That's all... Enjoy this free program... and try to watch a little
    less TV... There is a wonderful world  outside... Our world!

    Cordially,
    Dutra Lacerda


  Improvements TO DO as soon as possible:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 - To move this code to OOP so other crypto systems may be added.
  2 - Add UU/XX encode/decode routines, and IDEA routines (stronger than DES).
  3 - Create a Multi-Password Manager system.
  4 - Create a Menuing system to ease usage.
  5 - Making a nice Help System to explain all the fuzz about crypto-stuff
  6 - Make the move to W95 (it seems to be solid by now)
  7 - Getting some $$$ from all the work i'll be doing by then...


  Have a suggestion? I would like to ear it!

  Cordially,
  Dutra de Lacerda


P.S.: Other things i would like:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 - To see again a free Timor with the survivors of theyr holocaust.
  2 - To see the politicians, and the others, following the Dodo...
  3 - To Wake up in the morning and know i can trust...

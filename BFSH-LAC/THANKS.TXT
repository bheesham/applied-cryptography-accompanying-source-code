
    BLOWFISH IN CBC MODE v1.5a is a T-Pascal 7.0 implementation of the
    Blowfish cipher algorithm as described in Dr Dobb's, April 1994.
    This Archive includes sources of the Blowfish  Unit,  BlowFish-CBC
    Unit sources, and an BLW-CBC Unit usage programing demo.
    Thanks go to Bruce Schneier, author of the algorithm.

    Thanks, also, to all the Orwellian anonymous bureaucrats that  put
    our privacy at risk.
    They are a sign that we dismiss our civil responsibilities.

    Thanks to all  despotic personalities  who use  *OUR* institutions
    to stay in control...
    They are a sign that something very important is missing.

    All contributed to this work.

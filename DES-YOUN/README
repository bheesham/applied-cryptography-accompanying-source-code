This is a DES encryption library.
It suports ecb, cbc and MIT's pcbc encryption modes and also has
a fast implementation of crypt(3).
It also contains support routines to read keys from a terminal,
generate a random key, generate a key from an arbitary length string,
read/write encrypted data from/to a file descriptor, and an implementation of
sunOS des(1) command for file encryption.

The implementation was written so as to conform with the manual entry
for the des_crypt(3) library routines from MIT's project Athena.

destest should be run after compilation to test the des routines.
rpw should be run after compilation to test the read password routines.
The des program is a replacement for the sun des command.  I believe it
conforms to the sun binary.

The Imakefile is setup for use in the kerberos distribution.

These routines are best compiled with gcc v 2.1 or any other good
optimising compiler.
Just turn you optimiser up to the highest settings and run destest
after the build to make sure everything works.

I believe these routines are about the fastest DES routines that use
small lookup tables (4.5k) that are publicly available.
The fcrypt routine is faster than ufc's fcrypt (when compiling with
gcc2 -O2) on the sparc 2 (1410 vs 1270) but is not so good on other machines
(on a sun3/260 168 vs 336).

Patch2 posted to comp.sources.misc
Version 1.95 13/05/92 eay
	Added an alternative version of the D_ENCRYPT macro in
	ecb_encrypt and fcrypt.  Depending on the compiler, one version or the
	other will be faster.

Version 1.94 05/05/92 eay
	Fixed an incompatiblity between my string_to_key and the MIT
	 version.  When the key is longer than 8 chars, I was wrapping
	 with a different method.  To use the old version, define
	 OLD_STR_TO_KEY in the makefile.  Thanks to
	 viktor@newsu.shearson.com (Viktor Dukhovni).

Version 1.93 28/04/92 eay
	Fixed the VMS mods so that echo is now turned off in
	 read_password.  Thanks again to brennan@coco.cchs.su.oz.AU.
	MSDOS support added.  The routines can be compiled with
	 Turbo C (v2.0) and MSC (v5.1).  Make sure MSDOS is defined.

Patch1 posted to comp.sources.misc
Version 1.92 13/04/92 eay
	Changed D_ENCRYPT so that the rotation of R occurs outside of
	 the loop.  This required rotating all the longs in sp.h (now
	 called spr.h). Thanks to Richard Outerbridge <71755.204@CompuServe.COM>
	speed.c has been changed so it will work without SIGALRM.  If
	 times(3) is not present it will try to use ftime() instead.

Version 1.91 08/04/92 eay
	Added -E/-D options to des(1) so it can use string_to_key.
	Added SVR4 mods suggested by witr@rwwa.COM
	Added VMS mods suggested by brennan@coco.cchs.su.oz.AU.  If
	anyone knows how to turn of tty echo in VMS please tell me or
	implement it yourself :-).
	Changed FILE *IN/*OUT to *DES_IN/*DES_OUT since it appears VMS
	does not like IN/OUT being used.

Version 1.9 24/03/92 eay
	Now contains a fast small crypt replacement.
	Added des(1) command.
	Added des_rw_mode so people can use cbc encryption with
	enc_read and enc_write.

Version 1.8 15/10/91 eay
	Bug in cbc_cksum.
	Many thanks to Keith Reynolds (keithr@sco.COM) for pointing this
	one out.

Version 1.7 24/09/91 eay
	Fixed set_key :-)
	set_key is 4 times faster and takes less space.
	There are a few minor changes that could be made.

Version 1.6 19/09/1991 eay
	Finally go IP and FP finished.
	Now I need to fix set_key.
	This version is quite a bit faster that 1.51

Version 1.52 15/06/1991 eay
	20% speedup in ecb_encrypt by changing the E bit selection
	to use 2 32bit words.  This also required modification of the
	sp table.  There is still a way to speedup the IP and IP-1
	(hints from outer@sq.com) still working on this one :-(.

Version 1.51 07/06/1991 eay
	Faster des_encrypt by loop unrolling
	Fixed bug in quad_cksum.c (thanks to hughes@logos.ucs.indiana.edu)

Version 1.50 28/05/1991 eay
	Optimized the code a bit more for the sparc.  I have improved the
	speed of the inner des_encrypt by speeding up the initial and
	final permutations.

Version 1.40 23/10/1990 eay
	Fixed des_random_key, it did not produce a random key :-(

Version 1.30  2/10/1990 eay
	Have made des_quad_cksum the same as MIT's, the full package
	should be compatible with MIT's
	Have tested on a DECstation 3100
	Still need to fix des_set_key (make it faster).
	Does des_cbc_encrypts at 70.5k/sec on a 3100.

Version 1.20 18/09/1990 eay
	Fixed byte order dependencies.
	Fixed (I hope) all the word alignment problems.
	Speedup in des_ecb_encrypt.

Version 1.10 11/09/1990 eay
	Added des_enc_read and des_enc_write.
	Still need to fix des_quad_cksum.
	Still need to document des_enc_read and des_enc_write.

Version 1.00 27/08/1990 eay

	Fixed Perl 5.004 'hidden variables' warnings in test.pl scripts

	Stream:
		Adds UnsignedInt*() methods for PGP

		Dropped 'use POSIX' in File*.pm - watch this as it is not
		clear what used it.  It caused warnings with clashes of
		definitions.

		DataEncoding::*codeArray now handles the empty array

	Math-Lib::MPI has deprecated methods

	Some methods now die instead of return when programmer errors are
	detected.

	Some of the revisions are regressed from those of 1.15 ... due
	to CVS migrations.


1.15:
	Placed everything into CVS

1.1b:
	Maintenance release to correct missing SHA0 due to bad MANIFEST.
	Manually added SHA0 (3 sets of lines) to MANIFEST - remade.
	MANIFEST is still not made correctly, I couldn't quite make it tick.

	Note that I haven't tested the make install with this yet...

	Still some warnings on install ==> make

		Warning: the following files are missing in your kit:
		Math/BigInteger.pod
		Math/PRSG.pod
		Math/TrulyRandom.pod

	They all seem to be about pod's so no big drama.

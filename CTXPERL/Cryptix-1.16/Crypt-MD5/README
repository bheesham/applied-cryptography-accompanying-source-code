MD5 Extension Version 1.6

This is a Perl5 extension interface to the RSA Data Security Inc. MD5
Message Digest algorithm. Documentation is in MD5.pod.

To build the extension, unpack this distribution under the ext/
directory of your Perl source distribution, create the Makefile using
'perl Makefile.PL' and do a 'make'.

The test script gives a simple example of how to use the routines.
In particular 'make test' will perform a test of the routines to see
if they produce the expected output.

This version fixes the problem with dynamic linking of the module
under Solaris 2.x which happend in releases prior to 1.4. Thanks to Ken
Pizzini (ken@spry.com) for nailing this.

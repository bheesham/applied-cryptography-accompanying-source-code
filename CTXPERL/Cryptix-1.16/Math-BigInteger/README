This BigNum library is based on Eric Young's BigNum C library.


Functionality
=============

Could be better.
Perhaps a few predefined values.
A few extra functions, such as bit operations.

Some checking should be done to ensure that result arg is not a
paramter on those functions where it is disallowed (eg. mul)

Documentation
=============

Could be better.

Testing
=======

Could be better.

This directory contains two programs which transform an input stream of
bytes in a trivially reversible way.  Neither of these programs nor any
combination of them achieves privacy, but the results look unintelligible
to the casual observer.

TRAN takes the histogram of the first block of input bytes to seed a long
period PRNG (not claimed to be secure).  It uses the output of the PRNG to
transpose the bytes of input in up to 8KB blocks.  On EOF, the final short
block is transposed by itself.

PRNGXOR uses a constant array to seed the same PRNG which TRAN uses, and
XORs each byte of input with a byte from that PRNG.

Both TRAN and PRNGXOR are self-inverses.  They can be used alternately any
number of times,   { t = TRAN ;  p = PRNGXOR }

	t|p|t|p|t

to produce a more complex self-inverse function but any combination which
includes an adjacent pair of the same function reduces.  Eg.,

	t|p|t|t|p|t

reduces to

	t|p|p|t

to

	t|t

to a no-op.  This code is published here on clark.net for enjoyment of
playing with it and for reference for those people who have seen me refer
to it in my USENET postings.

	Possible goals for future releases:
DES & DES3 - Handle parity properly
Check that 3DES is correct
Instrument randpool to optionally track stats on what's going into it

	Generic cryptographic stuff:
Optimize the feedback modes a bit
Test modules further for endianness independence.
Add checks for Ctrl-C to lengthy encryption/decryption loops.  (Or
  maybe I shouldn't bother for the sake of speed?)

	Documentation:
Explain unpacking the kit better.
Better indexing; tell me what you've found lacking in the index!

	Demo programs:
Shadowing of files into X parts
Secure talk or telnet

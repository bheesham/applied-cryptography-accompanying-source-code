This directory contains demonstration files that use the modules
included in the Python Cryptography Toolkit.  

Note: These programs have version numbers of their own, which are not
necessarily the same as the version number of the Toolkit package.

cipher		Encrypt and decrypt sensitive files; type 'cipher -h'
		for a usage message.

voice		Allows secure voice communication over a TCP/IP link.
		Currently this is Linux-specific; changes to make it
		run on other systems would be greatly appreciated.

RSAgen.py	Generates a new RSA key.  Demonstrates using
		randpool.py, and maintains a file of random data in
		"randseed".  Requires that the IDEA and MD5 modules
		are installed.

testkey.py	RSA public/private key pair used by example programs.

Secure importing of Python modules:

	sign.py	        Sign all *.pyc files in a directory, using the
			key defined in testkey.py.

	secimp.py	Implementation of the secure 'import' command.

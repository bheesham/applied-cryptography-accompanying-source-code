Changes since version 0.0.3:

        * For block cipher objects, the IV can now be set to a desired
value without having to create a whole new object.

        * Warnings fixed; now compiles with only one warning under 
'gcc -Wall'.  Thanks to Holger Trapp for pointing them out.

	* Typos in sign.py, pgp.py, ElGamal.py fixed.  Thanks to Holger
Trapp for pointing out the one in sign.py.

        * SSLeay module added, along with secured versions of httplib.py,
nntplib.py, and a modified urllib.py.

        * Add triple DES (called DES3).

Changes since version 0.0.2:

	* README updated.

	* RSADSI's MD5 implementation replaced by Colin Plumb's, which
is public domain and about twice as fast.

	* MD2 and MD4 rewritten, and are now about 30-40% faster than
RSADSI's implementations.  The code is hereby placed in the public
domain; feel free to reuse it for your own purposes.

	* Public-key interface changed: Now the encrypt() and sign()
functions always require a string of random data (though RSA doesn't
use it).

	* Fixed a stupid braino in pgp.py which made reading private
keys impossible.

	* Added test data for SHA.

	* curiosa/ directory added, containing export-a-cryptosystem
.sig files.

Changes since version 0.0.1:

	* The PGP module can now read and output public and private
keys!  Barring major bugs or complaints about the interface, PGP key
handling (*not* message handling) is now complete.

	* RSA and ElGamal public key algorithms added.

	* New modules: Sapphire stream cipher, Ultra Fast Crypt(),
Diamond, RC5, MD2, MD4.  (Warning: The 32-bit version of RC5 has been
validated using the data in Rivest's paper, available at
ftp://theory.lcs.mit.edu/pub/rivest/rc5; however, the 16-bit version
has not been validated.  This is probably not of great concern, as
Rivest implies that 16-bit RC5 is only of academic interest.  I will
try to validate it in the near future, however.)

	* md5.md5() alias added for compatibility with the MD5 module
distributed with Python.  This method is deprecated, and will
eventually vanish.

	* Various bug fixes.  Most importantly: if interrupted,
buildkit will delete the partially constructed file.  (Thanks to Ken
Manheimer for pointing this out.)

	* Documentation greatly updated.

	* Lucifer module deleted (it's too slow and insecure for
anyone to be interested in using it); LOKI91 deleted (it's just plain
too slow).

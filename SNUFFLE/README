snuffle - generic hash-based encryption and decryption programs

snuffle and unsnuffle turn any good one-way hash function (such as
Merkle's Snefru) into a reasonably fast private-key encryption method.
You must have Snefru, or something providing the same Hash512()
interface, for snuffle and unsnuffle to work. Past that, snuffle and
unsnuffle should be perfectly portable.

On this Sun 4, snuffle and unsnuffle encrypt between two and three times
slower than crypt(1). However, they provide a lot more security.

snuffle is public domain. Send any comments to the newsgroup sci.crypt,
which the author reads whenever possible. I do *not* know whether
snuffle is legally exportable; it contains no encryption technology, but
I'm not going to try sending it outside the United States.

Start by making symbolic links or copies of snefru's hash512.o,
sboxes.o, snefru.h, and patchlevel.h in this directory. Then edit the
options in the Makefile and compile. Read snuffle.man and you're off.

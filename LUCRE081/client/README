This is s-lc, a sample -lucre client, provided as a wrapper to -lucre;
it is here just so you can see how to call the functions in the library.

To use it, first choose a wallet ID.  This is a subdirectory of your home
directory (or a full path name) where your coins will be stored.  The
default is ".ecwallet", or whatever $ECWALLET is set to.  The directory
you choose should _not_ yet exist.

Create the wallet by running:

    s-lc -o

This will ask for the account name and account password you got when you
opened your account with MT Bank.  If you want a different wallet id, use

    s-lc -w walletid -o

After you have created the wallet, just run the program as

    s-lc

or 

    s-lc -w walletid

Within the program, "?" will get you help.  Note that all amounts used by
the client are measured in _cents_.

We don't know how well the standard ecash client will react after you use your
account with this client (We think it gets confused when the bank reports a
higher message sequence number than it has sent).  If you have problems,
try copying the "status" file from your -lucre wallet to your ecash
directory (probably ~/.mtecash).  Success/failure stories are welcome,
along with ecash donations. :-) Suggestions for improvements to the
client will be very low on the priority list, as the client is primarily
for demonstration purposes.

Please read the README file in the -lucre directory for legal-type information,
especially regarding appropriate use of this software.

You can reach us, the development team for -lucre, at either of the
addresses below (in fact, use both, as the nym servers seem to be flaky).
Better yet, there is a mailing list to discuss the library; send mail
to majordomo@c2.org with body "subscribe dev-lucre" to subscribe.

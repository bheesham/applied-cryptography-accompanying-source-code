To compile the client, edit the Makefile to reflect the locations of the
include files and libraries for SSLeay and Berkeley db on your system
(if you don't have them, read the README file in the -lucre directory to
find out where to get them).  Then just do "make".  You should end up
with "s-lc", which you can install wherever you like.

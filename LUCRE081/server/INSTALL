To compile -lucre, edit the Makefile to reflect the locations of the include
files for SSLeay and Berkeley db on your system (if you don't have them,
read the README file to find out where to get them).  Then just do "make".
You should end up with "libucre.a".  If you want to make a shared library
instead, edit the Makefile as appropriate for your system.

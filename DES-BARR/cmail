#
# To send secret mail, envoke as you normally envoke mail.
#
# To receive mail, run your normal mailer and when you receive secret
# mail, send the message to cmail as follows:
#
#   s | cmail
#
# Note: the s| feature does not exist in the Berkely mailer.
#
# In both cases, you will be prompted for an encryption key.
# 
# NOTE: mail cleartext will appear in a temporory file which is
#       readable only by you or the super user during the time that you 
#       are editing the message.

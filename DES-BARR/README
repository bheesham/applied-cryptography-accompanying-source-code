This package is a DES-compatible encipherement package which makes it easy
to send and receive secret mail through electronic mailers.  

The most interesting products are:
   cipher (decipher) - the actual encipherment/decipherment program.
   cipher.1	     - the nroff compatible manual page for cipher (please read)
   atob, btoa	     - Binary to ASCII converters from compress 4.0 package
   cmail	     - A script to interface above with your mailer

To install:

Edit the Makefile:
   Define -DBSD or not as appropriate
   Change MANDIR and BINDIR as appropriate

Type "make"

   You may get some compiler warnings about & in front of arrays, invalid
   pointer combinations and optimization problems.  These are OK.  The
   important thing is too see if the testsuite passes.  If it does, the
   make will terminate normally.

Type "make install"

   You may want to read about the "~|" option to the BSD mailer and compose
   "encr" and "decr" scripts.

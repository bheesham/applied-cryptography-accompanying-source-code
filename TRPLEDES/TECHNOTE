Graven Imagery Technical Note
Compiling des3_port.c and des3_68k.c for the 68030 processor

Summary: For maximum performance, ensure that the SP tables
are guaranteed to be long-word alligned.

On the 68030 a considerable performance penalty is incurred
if the SP tables are not long-word alligned.  This table gives
representative results on a 68030 running at 50Mhz:

Blocks-per-second:        Alligned    Unalligned  Ratio

des3_port.c               4352        3840        1.133
des3_68k.c                6784        5632        1.204

These results may not pertain to execution on other processors.

Using the THINKC 5.04 compiler there is no way to force long-word
allignment.  Instead, after the penultimate link the resulting
object code must be manually inspected (using, for example, ResEdit)
to ensure:

(1) In the case of des3_port.c, that the in-line references in
the code itself have zero-mod-4 indirect indices from A5.  If not,
a two-byte padd (unsigned short Pad = 0x0123;) must be appended
immediately >following< the last entry of the SP8 array.

(2) In the case of des3_68.c, that searching the code for the hex
value "01010400" reports a find located on a zero-mod-4 address.
If not, a two-byte padd (dc.w 0x0123) must be inserted immediately
>before< the declaration of SP0.

These unpleasant niceties may not be required when using compilers
that permit or enforce long-word allignment of long-word data.

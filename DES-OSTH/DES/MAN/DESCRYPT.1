.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I descrypt
is an encryption/decryption program based on a software implementation of
the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm. 
.PP
The following options are understood by
.IR descrypt .
.TP
.B \-e
Selects encryption mode. The file specified by
.I infile
is encrypted and stored into the file specified by
.IR outfile .
.TP
.B \-d
Selects decryption mode. The file specified by
.I infile
is encrypted and stored into the file specified by
.IR outfile .
.TP
.B \-c
Selects checksum mode. A 64-bit cryptographic checksum is made from the
file specified by
.I infile
and the result is stored in the file specified by
.IR outfile.
The function used is
.IR des_cbc_cksum (3).
.TP
.B \-h
Indicates that the key is an 64-bit hexadecimal value directly specifying
a DES key. The key may have an optional
.B 0x
or
.B 0X
prepended. No parity adjustment is necessary to the key. The option works both
on a key given with the 
.B \-k
option, and a prompted for key.
.TP
.B \-k
Takes the next argument as an ascii representation of the key to use.
The actual DES key is generated by the
.IR des_string_to_key (3)
function, or
.IR des_hex_to_cblock (3)
(and a parity adjustment) if the
.B \-h
option is used.
.TP
.B \-C
Selects
.IR des_cbc_encrypt (3)
(Cipher Block Chaining) as encryption/decryption function. 
.TP
.B \-P
Selects
.IR des_pcbc_encrypt (3)
(Modified Cipher Block Chaining) as encryption/decryption function. 
.TP
.B \-E
Selects
.IR des_ecb2_encrypt (3)
(Electronic Code Book) as encryption/decryption function. 
.TP
.B \-F
Selects
.IR des_cfb8_encrypt (3)
(8-bit Cipher FeedBack) as encryption/decryption function. 
.TP
.B \-O
Selects
.IR des_ofb8_encrypt (3)
(8-bit Output FeedBack) as encryption/decryption function
.TP
.B \-a
Forces
.I descrypt
to produce encrypted data as a sequence of ascii lines with a single 64-bit
hexadecimal number, with a
.B 0x
prepended, on each line. In decryption mode,
only such lines, with an optional
.B 0x
or
.B 0X
prepended, are accepted as input. Lines with other information are
ignored and does not affect the process. If
.I descrypt
is in checksum mode, only a single line with the 64-bit result is produced.
.PP
If no key is specified with the
.B \-k
flag, the user is prompted for a key by the
.IR des_read_password (3)
function, or
.IR des_read_hexkey (3)
if the
.B \-h
option is used. The result is identical to key provided with the
.B \-k
flag.
.PP
If no encryption/decryption algorithm is specified with any of the
.BR \-C ,
.B \-P
or
.B \-E
flags,
.IR des_cbc_encrypt (3)
is used.
.PP
The default input and output files are
.I stdin
and
.IR stdout.
.PP
The encrypted output is padded up to the nearest multiple of eight bytes
if any of the
.IR des_cbc_encrypt ,
.I des_pcbc_encrypt
or
.I des_ecb2_encrypt
functions are used.

.SH BUGS
No cleanup of internally used data (yet).

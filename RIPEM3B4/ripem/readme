README    Mark Riordan  mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu   

This is a distribution of the public key encryption program RIPEM.
It is oriented towards use with electronic mail, and provides a
subset of the capabilities described in Internet RFC 1113.

To install:
   On Unix, type  make  and follow the directions.
   On MS-DOS Microsoft C, type  makedos. 
   On MS-DOS Borland C++ 4.0, use ripem/main/ripem.ide

Binaries (and source) are available on ripem.msu.edu.

All the code *I* wrote is in the public domain, and the code by 
other private contributors is also essentially in the public domain.  
However, the cryptographic smarts all come from the RSAREF toolkit, 
found in the rsaref/ directory tree.
RSAREF is licensed free of charge from RSA Data Security, but it is 
not in the public domain--see the license agreement in doc/.

For more information, see the files in doc/.

Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution
outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,
the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.
I don't agree with US export restrictions, but I intend to comply.

Thank you.

Mark R.

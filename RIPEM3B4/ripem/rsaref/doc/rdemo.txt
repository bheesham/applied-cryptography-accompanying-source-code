This note describes RDEMO, a program that demonstrates features
of the RSAREF cryptographic toolkit.

RDEMO is a simple program that exercises RSAREF's cryptographic
operations. With RDEMO, you can perform the cryptographic operations
of signing, sealing, verifying, and opening files, as well as
generating key pairs. There can be up to three different key pairs,
so you can simulate a multi-user environment.

RDEMO has a main menu with six commands. The main menu is displayed
when you start up RDEMO, and is displayed again after RDEMO performs
a command. After you select a command RDEMO prompts for parameters
such as file names.

RDEMO's commands and their parameters are summarized in the following
table.

Note that these commands have the same names, but different
parameters and functions than those in version 1.0. There is no
maximum file size in the new program. The old program has been
renamed to OLDRDEMO.


          RDEMO COMMAND                       PARAMETERS

S - Sign a file                 name of file
  digest content                which private key to sign with
  encrypt digest with           message-digest algorithm
    private key                 name of file in which to save
                                  signature

V - Verify a signed file        name of file
  digest content                which public key to verify with
  decrypt signature with        message-digest algorithm
    public key                  name of file in which signature is
  compare result to digest        saved

E - sEal a file                 name of file
  generate random data          name of file in which to save
    encryption key, IV(*)          encrypted content
  encrypt key with public       which public key to seal with
    key                         data encryption algorithm
  encrypt content with key      names of files in which to save
                                  encrypted key and IV

O - Open a sealed file          name of file in which encrypted
  decrypt encrypted key           content is saved
    with private key            name of file in which to save
  decrypt encrypted content       recovered content
    with key                    which private key to open with
                                data encryption algorithm
                                names of files in which encrypted key
                                  and IV are saved

G - Generate a keypair          length of key in bits (508-1024)
  generate RSA public/          name of file in which to save key pair
    private key pair

Q - Quit


(*) Initialization vector for cipher-block chaining mode.


NOTES

  1. You select keys by number: '1', '2', or '3'. The first two key
     pairs are built in. The third is generated by RDEMO's 'Generate a
     key pair' command.

  2. How you specify file names to RDEMO depends on your operating
     system. RDEMO recognizes the special file name '-' as the
     standard output stream (typically the screen display). You can
     usually cancel an RDEMO command by giving a blank line in
     response to a prompt for a parameter.

  3. RDEMO reads and writes all files except the key pair file (which
     it only writes) in binary mode.

  4. Message-digest algorithm choices are MD2 and MD5.

  5. For data encryption, the choices are DES, DESX, two-key
     triple-DES (DES-EDE2), and three-key triple-DES (DES-EDE3).

  6. If you want RDEMO not to display the main menu or any prompts,
     put the string '-s' on the command line when you start RDEMO.
     This is useful when RDEMO's input stream comes from a script
     file.

  7. RDEMO seeds RSAREF's random number generator with a fixed value.
     As a result, RDEMO sessions with the same commands and
     parameters produce the same results. The use of a fixed seed
     value is not recommended for non-demonstration applications.

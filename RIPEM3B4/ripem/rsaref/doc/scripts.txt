RDEMO comes with several test scripts that test RSAREF cryptographic
operations of various key sizes.

The test scripts are: '508.in', '512a.in', '512b.in', '767.in' and
'1024.in'. The scripts consist of RDEMO commands. To exercise a
script, redirect RDEMO's input to the script.  For example, on a UNIX
or DOS system you would run the command

     rdemo < 508.in

to exercise the test script '508.in'. Use the '-s' flag to suppress
RDEMO's prompts.

The scripts work with a number of input files. Each script also
produces output files that you can compare against reference files
supplied with RDEMO. Both the scripts and the reference files are
stored in the 'rdemo/scripts' subdirectory.

See the file 'rdemo.txt' in the 'doc' subdirectory for more
information on the demonstration program.


'508.in' script

     1.   Generates a 508-bit RSA key pair, writing the key to
          '508.key'.

     2.   Signs 'file' with private key and MD5 message-digest
          algorithm, writing signature to '508-5.sig'.
 
     3.   Verifies signature.

     4.   Seals 'file' in envelope with public key and DES-CBC
          data encryption algorithm, writing encrypted file to
          '508-1.env', encrypted data encryption key to '508-1.key',
          and initialization vector to '508-1.iv'.

     5.   Opens envelope and displays result: should be "Envelope
          opened."

'512a.in' script

     1.   Signs 'file' with first built-in private key and MD2
          message-digest algorithm, writing signature to '512a2.sig'.

     2.   Verifies signature.

     3.   Repeats (1) and (2) with MD5. Signature in '512a5.sig'.

     4.   Seals 'file' in envelope with first built-in public key and
          DES-CBC data encryption algorithm, writing encrypted file to
          '512a1.env', encrypted data encryption key to '512a1.key',
          and initialization vector to '512a1.iv'.

     5.   Opens envelope and displays result.

     6.   Repeats (4) and (5) with DESX-CBC, DES-EDE2-CBC, and
          DES-EDE3-CBC. Files: '512ax.*', '512a2.*', '512a3.*'.

     7.   Repeats (3-5) on 'bigfile'. Result should be "Envelope
          opened \ This is a big file", repeated a few times.

'512b.in'

     Same as '508.in', except that '508' becomes '512b', and second
     built-in key pair is used, rather than generating a new one.

'767.in' and '1024.in'

     Same as '508.in', except that '508' becomes '767' or '1024';
     new key pairs are generated in both cases.

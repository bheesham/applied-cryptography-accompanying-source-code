Here are the Mimic Functions.

Although the copyright notice says that you are free to circulate the
code, I would appreciate it if you would hold off until the code and the
manual are in a better and more bug-free shape. Please send me any comments.

This C version should run on just about any computer.  It has been tested
on 
o	a Sun-4 running SunOS 4.0.3c,
o	a DECstation running ultrix 2.1 (sorry, I know 4.0 is current)
o	an IBM PC using Microsoft C 5.00 (huge model)
o	a Macintosh running Think-C 4.0

I have tested the program, but not enought to make any firm statements about
bugs. Thus, I would appreciate it if you could report back any problems you
find. Also, if you port the program to another system I would appreciate
getting a copy. 

Finally, one additional caveat. The US Government has restrictions on
the export of cryptographic equiptment. Although I have always assumed
that the MimicFunctions are more parlour game than rival for DES, I
would like to warn you that it might be more politic not to send
this listing outside of the country. I realize that this limitation
may seem sort of silly in the age of the lightening-fast network, but
the law is fairly complex and untested.

Mark,

Thanks for your comments. After posting that note I've since discovered
that a) my scheme is not original, b) you do indeed need more than
two rounds, and c) it's also important that the keys for each round be
distinct.

Somebody pointed me to the paper "A New Class of Cryptosystems Based
on Interconnection Networks" by
michaelp@terpsichore.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (so much for all of the
world's cryptographic talent being in the US! :-) Anyway, this paper
cites previous work in the field that shows three iterations of a
keyed one-way function to be sufficient as long as at least two
different keys are used. The paper in question is by Zheng, Matsumoto
and Imai and appeared in Crypto 89.

So I am now proposing that "my" cipher consist of three calls to the
MD-5 primitive function "transform", and that the keys for each step
be different. Since the subkey for each round is 64 bytes long, it
should suffice to accept one 64-byte key and to use MD-5 in its usual
mode to generate the rest of the subkeys by repetitive iteration.

Comments?

Phil

I got some requests for the source to the implementation I made of
the encryption algorithm described by Phil Karn here a few weeks ago.
Phil mentioned a couple of references for earlier discoveries of the
same basic idea.  I was able to look up the one in Crypto '89 (see
the comment below for the exact reference).  It uses the basic idea
of a one-way function iterated three times, but doesn't specifically
choose the MD4/MD5 functions.

Here is the source to the basic module which encrypts a 32-byte block
of data using two 48-byte keys to produce a 32-byte output.  To make
this into an actual encryption program you have to build the framework
that reads the keys and reads and writes the data.  You also need to
decide whether you will use a simple ECB mode or a CBC.  I wrote code
to do CBC but I'm not that happy with it.  I'd want to take a look
at some other examples before I would upload it.

This code relies on the library function "bcopy", which copies bytes from
its first argument to its second argument, with the number of bytes in
the third argument.  Some systems may have to change this to "memcpy"
or something similar, and possibly reverse the order of the first two
arguments.

It calls the function "Transform" to do the hashing.  This is in MD5.C
available through FTP from <rsa.com>.  You can discard the other routines
in MD5.C, since they aren't used, and you will have to remove the "static"
declaration from Transform in that module so that it can be callable from
outside.

This code has compiled and run.
